# Scratch
Personally going through [Writing an Operating From Scratch](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf). I felt that I didn't learn anything from OS design class I took in college, so I'm going to sit down and read a bunch during this summer.

Will be doing this periodically when I'm not playing games or learning to make a game.

Currently I'm on section 3.4.
